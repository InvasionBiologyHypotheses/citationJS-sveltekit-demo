# Citation JS example using Sveltekit

A super simple example of how to use [Citation-JS](https://citation.js.org/) in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## To run locally

Uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

You'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed. If you don't already have pnpm installed you can either install it globally on your machine by running

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

or simply appending `npx` to the beginning of the following commands.

Once cloned to your local machine, install all the dependencies with

```bash
pnpm i
```

from within the repo's root directory (or `npx pnpm i` if you don't want to install pnpm... but you should ðŸ˜‰).

To start the development server run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can then access the local development server at http://localhost:3000/

If you have something else running on port 3000 locally you can change the port by starting the server with (for instance, port 8989):

```bash
pnpm dev -- --port=8989
```
